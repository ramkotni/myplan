💵 REVENUE PLAN
Assume 60% Occupancy at ₹1,200 per night per room:

₹1,200 × 10 rooms × 18 days/month = ₹2,16,000/month

If food charges are separate or bundled, add:

Boarding Revenue (optional): ₹300/room/day × 18 × 10 = ₹54,000

Total Monthly Revenue ≈ ₹2.7 Lakhs

📊 BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
➤ What is Break-Even?
Break-even is the point where your total income = expenses, and you're not in loss or profit.

Monthly profit: ₹2.7L (revenue) - ₹1.7L (expenses) = ₹1L

Break-even in construction investment:

₹1 Cr / ₹1L = ~100 months (8.5 years) (worst case)

With higher occupancy or food markup: break-even in 5–6 years

🏗️ FUTURE EXPANSION (PHASE 2+)
You can expand gradually:

Add 10–15 more rooms (another floor or wing)

Add swimming pool, banquet hall, or recreational area

Switch to premium/boutique model based on reviews
